# 🏨 Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, established for over 20 years, operates multiple hotel categories including AtliQ Seasons, AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Bay, and AtliQ Palace, catering to diverse customer segments. Despite their strong presence, they are losing revenue and market share due to rising competition.

The goal of this project is to leverage data analytics to provide actionable insights and recommendations for business growth.
# 🚀 Key Objectives
1.Analyze occupancy rates across cities, room types, and booking platforms.
2.Identify trends in revenue realization.
3.Understand customer behavior based on booking patterns.                       
4.Provide data-driven recommendations to improve performance.
# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python: Core programming language for data analysis.                          
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and visualization.          
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
# 📊 Data Analysis Workflow
1.Understanding the Business Problem

Identified key questions, such as    occupancy rates and revenue trends.

2.Data Collection

Worked with booking data stored in CSV files.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaned and explored data to understand structure and patterns.

4.Data Cleaning

Addressed issues like missing values and outliers (e.g., negative guest counts).

5.Data Transformation

Created key metrics like Occupancy Percentage, which served as the primary KPI.

6.Insights & Visualization

Generated actionable insights using visualizations and statistical analysis.
# 📈 Key Insights
